          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            On 24 December 2020 the United Kingdom and European Union finalised
            a post-Brexit trade deal, just days before the hard deadline of a 31
            December withdrawal. The conclusion of these hard-fought
            negotiations proved a landmark seal on a process initiated over four
            years ago following the UK’s 2016 EU membership referendum. For
            some, the occasion was a triumph for British autonomy and trade, for
            others, a somber withdrawal from invaluable regional partners.

          <h2>Research Outline</h2>
          <p>
            This report details a broad analysis of tweets containing the term
            ‘Brexit’ gathered on 24 December. The resulting tweets, which span a
            time frame of 11:38am-4:42pm, were gathered using a
            <a
              href="https://gist.github.com/TurnerHaa/42ea2f5a59efb28d5fabf07da3d369aa"
              >Python script</a
            >
            designed to obtain and write tweet data into a Comma Separated
            Values format.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the 138,254 tweets gathered over a period just over five hours-
            83,742, or 60.6%, were retweets. However,
            <a href="https://www.danah.org/papers/TweetTweetRetweet.pdf"
              >Boyd et al.</a
            >
            (2010) argue retweets are not only conversational, but turn linear
            conversation into broader, overlapping discourse often with
            additional meaning.
          </p>
          <h4 style="text-align: center">Tweet to Retweet Ratio</h4>
          <div class="chart" id="chart1"></div>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206076"
              >Majmundar et al.</a
            >
            (2018) simplify the explanation with their
            <i>Why We Retweet</i> scale which suggests that retweets are equally
            valid forms of expression as original tweets, able to reflect a
            range of positions including- approval, argument, attention and
            entertainment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For these reasons, retweets are included across all aspects of the
            analysis unless otherwise specified.
          </p>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h4 style="text-align: center">Tweets Per Minute</h4>
          <div class="chart" id="chart2"></div>
          <p>
            The timeline displayed here reflects the volume of tweets made each
            minute across the entire dataset. Expectedly, the sharp upward
            trajectory just before 3:00pm reflects the moments immediately
            preceding the announcement of the deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to 2:35pm, the average tweet rate was 217 tweets per minute
            (TPM). This already notable discourse is likely a reflection of an
            anticipatory news cycle providing heavy Brexit coverage, the looming
            withdrawal deadline of December 31 and potentially Christmas Eve
            meaning more users had the free time to engage in online discourse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curiously, a small uptick in tweet volume reaching 283 tweets
            appears to proceed a much greater increase in overall volume,
            perhaps suggesting a certain community was informed of the deal’s
            confirmation before it reached mainstream conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 2:30pm and 3:00pm the TPM more than triples the prior
            average, reaching a peak of 1099 at 2:56pm. The peak is then
            followed by a steadier decline ending at 4:42pm, with an average of
            280 TPM for the final hour.

          <div class="chart" id="chart3"></div>
          <p>
            Also, at 2:56pm, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon shared her
            misgivings with the Brexit process in a tweet that quickly became
            the most retweeted across the data at 5,231 retweets, suggesting her
            contribution potentially influenced the graph’s highest point.

            Condensing the graph to a two-hour span between 14:00pm-4:00pm and
            separating tweets and retweets corroborates this argument as
            retweets peak the same minute as Sturgeon’s post.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, although original tweets match the trend of a sharp
            rise from 14:35, a peak tweet volume of 501 wasn’t achieved until 17
            minutes after retweets had peaked. This might reflect a delay for
            users to compose their own original thoughts as well as the absence
            of news and other retweet bots artificially inflating the volume of
            earlier reactions.

            The vast majority of users contributed a single tweet through the

            tweets per user.

            However, the top tweeters contributed significantly more than

            over 10x the average.

          <p>
            The range of values within the top 10 tweeters was still
            surprisingly divided, with the top three tweeters producing a
            combined 470 tweets versus the 460 totals of the remaining seven. In

            The substantially higher than average tweet volume and political
            nature of the content could imply the vast majority if not all top
            accounts are bots;
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1606/1606.06356.pdf"
              >Howard and Kollanyi</a
            >
            (2016) who observed similar hashtags during the 2016 EU referendum
            found that accounts with substantial tweet rates were potentially
            indicative of bots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Utilising the online
            <a href="https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/">‘Botometer’</a> tool, all
            of the top 10 accounts were tested to unveil their bot score before
            a second human screening. A 2018

            >
            looking to identify Twitter bots used the botometer API with a
            threshold of 0.43 on a scale of 0-1 above which an account was
            considered a bot. The online tool uses a 0-5 scale so assuming the
            working limit in this case was 2.15.

          <p>
            Assuming Botometer is correct, only @PandaScottish, @HatsofDefiance
            and @colinth7 were considered likely to be human, the large tweet to
            retweet ratio of the first two a good indication of bucking the
            trend of the dataset. @colinth7 for whom all collected tweets were
            retweets was more suspicious, however review of non-retweet content
            using Twitter’s advanced search reveals the account regularly
            contributes unique, eloquent replies and was actively doing so as
            recently as 8 January.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar activity traits from @JKLDNMAD, @SerendipitySays and
            @JohnKLDN might also suggest these accounts are unique. However,
            these were hard to distinguish even on human review. Two accounts
            both contain KLDN, an acronym that was hard to identify but repeat
            appearance seems at best suspiciously coincidental.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both account bios also contain ‘Does not like Brexit’, identify as
            Lancastrian, and frequent the hashtag ‘ToryBrexit’ suggesting they
            are not only bots, but potentially part of the same network.
          </p>
          <p>
            @SerendipitySays was harder to clarify, however their bio
            self-identification as an ‘over-enthusiastic retweeter’ and
            ten-year-old account suggested they may in fact be a human.
          </p>
          <p>
            All three accounts exhibit a high retweet rate but also wrote well
            written responses to certain threads outside of the dataset. This
            may either indicate nearly indistinguishable bots, or users with
            semi-automated accounts that they occasionally sign into and use
            themselves.

            @NicolaSturgeon dominates the top retweets of the dataset with her
            most retweeted tweet retweeted 219% more than the second most
            retweeted by the news source @spectatorindex. Furthermore,
            Sturgeon’s tweets also make up the 6th and 7th most retweeted in the
            dataset giving here a combined total of 7,228 retweets in just the
            top ten. It is worth noting that given the data runs only until
            approximately two hours after the announcement, the implication is
            not only that Sturgeon was a substantial voice in the discourse, but
            one of the quickest figures to engage with the topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sturgeon is wholly critical of Brexit citing issues with the
            economy, Erasmus and lack of Scottish autonomy in the decision.
            Stieglitz and Dang-Xuan (2012) found that tweets containing apparent
            positive or negative emotions were most likely to spread throughout
            Twitter, perhaps enhanced in this case by Sturgeon’s authoritative
            position on the topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second two most retweeted posts were by news sources
            @spectatorindex and @BBCBreaking. The BBC’s followers would suggest
            a substantially larger reach however they fall 200 retweets short of
            @spectatorindex.
          </p>
          <p>
            An explanation can be found in the tweet timings, with @BBCBreaking
            tweeting the story at 2:52pm a full eight minutes after
            @spectatorindex even despite the lack of verification on the latter
            account. This might suggest user’s valued the speed of news delivery
            over reliability.
            <a

              >McGregor and Molyneux</a
            >
            (2018) have research that indicated US journalists, especially less
            experienced ones, were more willing to accept Twitter news as fact
            often by virtue of the platform. However, the BBC also maintains
            several other news accounts and may have a greater number of total
            retweets across their coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interestingly, only one tweet reflected anything vaguely pro-Brexit
            (6 being anti-Brexit and 3 being news sites.) @DPJHodges who writes
            for Mail on Sunday expressed support for Boris having completed
            Brexit, however at 355 retweets his relative voice is retweeted
            1,373% less than Sturgeon’s number one critique. This might suggest
            the majority of tweets were made by Brexit critics but this is an
            incredibly vague inference given the total size of the dataset. It
            may also be that anti-Brexit sentiment simply disseminated faster
            than pro-Brexit comment, but even this requires further
            investigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably, all accounts have substantial followings with the lowest
            (@JulieHSoc1 2,003) still well above the sitewide average of 707.
            However Julie's 2,003 followers are substantially lower than th
            141,000 of the next lowest suggesting her post was a single 'viral'
            share.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, the average for the dataset is 53,046. Top followed
            users in the data include @Reuters, @CGTNOfficial, @SkyNews, @CNN
            and @nytimes- with double digit million followings. Therefore the
            breaking nature of the story likely explains this substantial
            increase. Despite this, none of these publications proved top
            retweeteted with, users seemingly preferring to amplify what appear
            to be personal accounts.

            A total of 40.2% had geolocation enabled for their tweets, a
            surprisingly large figure given the feature is off by default. This
            may be users actively opting into geolocation for their own data or
            transparency, but may also reflect users who blindly accepted by
            activation prompts by Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            A much greater percentage, 70.4% of users had enabled location data,
            the equivalent of 97,276 users.
          </p>
          <p>
            As expected, the UK and England dominate the highest listed
            countries with a combined 8,372 users listing their location as one
            of the two.

            Scotland proved the third highest country with 2,594. Interestingly,
            included in the count are 60 counts of ‘Scotland, Europe’ and a
            further 39 ‘Republic of Scotland’, a trend also seen in 55 Welsh
            location entries containing 'Republic of Wales', contributing 11.6%
            of the total Welsh location entries.
          </p>
          <p>
            This seems to suggest users were using the location box as a form of
            quiet protest against Brexit. This may also explain why Brussels
            ranked fourth for total tweets by city and a combined 1010 users
            entered either Europe or European Union.
          </p>
          <p>
            A more obvious indication of sentiment was witnessed in some
            individual users, for example @Kilsally who’s location ‘Sold to the
            EU by Boris’ seemingly indicates dissatisfaction with the resultant
            deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Four EU member states; France, Netherlands, Italy and Spain
            contribute to the top 10 countries, interestingly Belgium ranks 13th
            despite Brussels being the fourth ranked city. This might further
            suggest that ‘Brussels’ as a location is a form of subtle protest
            against the UK’s decision/solidarity with the EU.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s worth noting that whilst ‘Brexit’ has become incredibly
            normalised in press coverage across the UK, it may not have gained
            the same traction in other regions and, whilst the results here are
            what we might expect, it’s important to knowledge linguistic
            differences may be slightly distorting location rankings.

              alt="A word cloud of terms associated with Brexit taken from the dataset with some larger and smaller than others based on how frequently they occur. The entire word cloud is in the shape and colour of the Twitter logo."

          <p>
            A word cloud of the entire collected Tweet text doesn’t immediately
            unveil unexpected trends or sentiment but explains existing stances.
            ‘Eu’, ‘Deal’ and ‘UK’ are expectedly large terms both due to their
            fundamental relation to the discourse and the high likelihood of the
            terms appearing in news and other retweet bots breaking the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medium sized text deepens understanding of the dataset. The high
            presence of ‘Johnson’, ‘Boris’ and ‘Pm’ reflect the obvious coverage
            of the British prime minister across the dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            A high presence of Scottish terms: ‘Scotland’ and ‘Nicolasturgeon’,
            reflect trends observed in location data where Glasgow and Edinburgh
            were second only to London in terms of tweet volume. Curiously,
            ‘spin’ reflects the opening line of Nichola Sturgeon’s most
            retweeted post, reflecting the power of her single voice in the
            dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few other political figures can also be spotted with the data
            including ‘Ursula’ and ‘Von’, referring to Ursula Von Der Leen the
            President of the European Commission and ‘Nigel’, potentially a
            reference to Nigel Farage, the former Member of European parliament
            and renowned Brexit proponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several ‘hot’ talking points around Brexit also emerge including
            ‘fish’, relating to the contentious point of handling British
            fishing territory in the trade deal and ‘Erasmus’, amplified by
            Nicola Sturgeon and referring to the student exchange program that
            many lamented losing through Brexit.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Overall, the impact of the trade deal announcement can clearly be
            seen to have drastically spiked an already healthy Twitter discourse
            surrounding the term ‘Brexit’. It’s difficult with the level of
            analysis undertaken here to provide definitive sentiment, but these
            preliminary findings indicate an anti-Brexit sentiment amongst the
            discussion’s loudest voices, with an English/Scottish centric
            dominance of location data.
          </p>
          <p>
            More broadly, the biggest implication for this data are the many
            barriers to assessing a ‘representative’ discourse through Twitter
            analysis. Temporal decisions affect who is tweeting and where, bots
            are potentially near indistinguishable from human users with
            implications for assumptions placed on both parties.
