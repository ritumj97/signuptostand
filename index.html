                    <h2>Why should women #SignUpToStand?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A century has passed since women were given the right to
                        enter the corridors of power in the British Parliament
                        under the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act.
                        Although Constance Markiewicz holds the title of being
                        the first woman elected to the House of Commons in 1918,
                        Nancy Astor was the first female MP to take up a seat at
                        Westminster in 1919. Labour MP Diane Abbott was the
                        first black woman elected to Parliament in the UK.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For 4,503 male MPs, there have only been 491 female MPs
                        in the last 100 years, according to a BBC report.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        50:50 Parliament is a cross-party campaign founded by
                        Frances Scott in 2013 - when there were three times more
                        men in Parliament than women - to achieve gender
                        equality in Parliament and other levels of elected
                        office. Scott first launched an online petition which
                        received over 50,000 signatures from people supporting
                        women’s progress in politics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the initiative, #SignUpToStand and #AskHerToStand
                        campaigns were started along with group events,
                        peer-to-peer advice, buddy schemes and ‘Become A
                        Friend’. Currently a 30 + strong team, they have
                        encouraged nearly 2,500 women from various backgrounds
                        and ethnicities to #SignUpToStand by offering various
                        access and entry points.

                        Scraping tweets related to the campaign on Sign Up To
                        Stand - Ask Her To Stand Day from May 2020 to November
                        2023 and drawing a comparison to the data of women in
                        Parliament will help analyse the significance of similar
                        initiatives supporting women in politics and power.  For this project, I scraped just a little over 2,000 tweets with the hashtag ‘Sign Up To Stand’ using Apify’s tweet-flash scraper export.</p>

                    <h2>Who are the top tweeters?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unsurprisingly, the official X account of the 50:50
                        Parliament campaign takes up a major chunk - nearly 65
                        per cent - of the total number of posts since 2020. The
                        account regularly posts announcements about community
                        workshops encouraging women to stand for elections as
                        well as retweeting and congratulating female candidates
                        from across parties in various elections in the UK. The
                        account also retweets posts of its new CEO Lyanne
                        Nichols and founder Frances Scott who share posts and
                        statistics about women in power.

                        The second top tweeter is also not a big surprise.
                        Scott, who goes by the username @FScott5050, mostly
                        retweets posts related to the SignUpToStand and
                        AskHerToStand campaigns and those posted by 50:50
                        Parliament. The last original post on X by Scott was on
                        November 21 - AskHerToStand day - where she shared a
                        video of her asking women to 'Sign Up To Stand' on the
                        50:50 website.

                        populated with original posts and retweets criticising
                        ultra-processed foods and demanding better food
                        education in schools. On November 22 this year, she
                        extended support to the 'Ask Her To Stand Up' campaign
                        by pushing out a post urging women to 'Sign Up To
                        Stand'.

                        categories - data-driven, personalised and supportive
                        while all tweets carry a similar theme of inspiration
                        and powerful women.

                        The hashtags #SignUpToStand and #AskHerToStand are the
                        two pillar hashtags of the campaign mostly used together
                        to strengthen the message on social media and increase
                        the chances of it going viral, especially on the
                        particular day.

                        The year 2021 saw the most number of X posts for the
                        campaign - 653 out of the overall 2011 tweets spread
                        across 2020 and 2023. November has seen the most spike
                        in the number of X posts for #SignUpToStand as the ‘Ask
                        Her To Stand’ Day falls on the 21st of the month.
                        However, from 358 X posts in November 2020 to 119 in
                        2023, the campaign seems to be gradually losing steam in
                        social media. The tweet rate is the highest - 12 per cent - on 'Sign Up To Stand' day in November 2020 compared to the last campaign day in 2023. In 2020 and 2021, August was the least
                        active month for the campaign on social media while 2022
                        and 2023 (respectively) saw January and September
                        producing the lowest number of posts.

                        the public to make a change by comparing statistics of

                        motivate women who are anxious about taking the first

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        The number of women MPs in parliament surpassed 5 per
                        cent for the first time in 1987. The highest jump was in
                        1997 when the proportion of women MPs doubled from 9 per
                        cent to 18 per cent. After the Sign Up To Stand campaign
                        was launched in 2013, the 2015 election saw a rise from
                       <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01250/" target ="_blank"> 22 per cent to 30 per </a>cent. In the 2019 general
                        election, the largest-ever proportion of women MPs - 220
                        out of total 650 - entered the House of Commons hitting
                        an all-time high of 34 per cent. Of the 140 MPs elected
                        for the first time in 2019, 57 were women. As of
                        December 2023, there are 225 women MPs.

                        Women are more likely than men (75 per cent versus 54
                        per cent) to say that they decided to try to become an
                        MP because someone asked them to, as per a 2018 study by
                        Fawcett Society, which makes ‘Sign Up To Stand’ a key
                        campaign to encourage female participation in politics.
                        At least 40 per cent of male MPs planned their political
                        career six months ahead of being selected for their seat
                        compared to a merely 18 per cent among women, the report
                        said.
